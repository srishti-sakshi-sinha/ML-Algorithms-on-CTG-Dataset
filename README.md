# ML-Algorithms-on-CTG-Dataset

This is a project I did in my M.Tech. under the guidance of my Project Guide, Dr. V. Uma, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, Pondicherry University.
In this project we have applied several Machine Learning Algorithms on a CTG Dataset for its classification into three categories Normal, Suspicious and 
Pathological. We applied SMOTE for the upsampling and balancing of the dataset and compared the performance measures of each model.
